I am building an image gen studio named "T4 Canvas". It is a power user interface for generating images with various AI models, including:

- Nano Banana Pro (from Gemini)
- Flux 2
- gpt-image-1.5
- Seedream

The image studio will enable users to generate and edit images using all of these models for a single, flat fee every month.

Your task is to build an incredible marketing homepage for this app. I want it to be creative and unique. Really push the limits of your design capabilities.

Once initialized, I want you to create TWELVE different designs. Each design should be creative and unique from all the others that you create. They should be hosted on /1, /2, /3, /4, /5, etc., respectively.

Don't use any MCPs, skills, or other features in your harness.

Show me your organic built-in capabilities for tasteful design.

Use the following port for the dev server: 4000
